### How to Use

Download the project, open "RideCompare.xcodeproj", get a Google API Key (Make an account at https://cloud.google.com and then go here https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials then under "Create Credentials" select "API Key", and lastly enable Google Place API for iOS, which can be found in Google search), and fill it under Constants.swift at the following line:

```
let GOOGLE_API_KEY = "YOUR KEY HERE"
```

After you that, select your phone under devices near the play button in the top left of Xcode and then press play. If it gives you an error about creating an Apple Developer account, you can do that at https://developer.apple.com.
